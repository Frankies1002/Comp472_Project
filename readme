#CIFAR-10 Image Classification
##Overview

This project implements and compares four machine learning models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories:

    Naive Bayes
    Decision Tree
    Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN - VGG11)

The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Feature extraction using a pre-trained ResNet-18 model and dimensionality reduction using PCA are employed to improve performance for certain models.
